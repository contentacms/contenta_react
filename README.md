# Contenta React Demo
with Redux, Aphrodite, and server-side rendering
http://react.contentacms.io/

## Quick Start
```bash
git clone git@github.com:contentacms/contenta_react.git
cd contenta_react
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn build && yarn start`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](#deployment) for more information.

After running ```yarn run build```, starts the app in production mode, which will include a server-side render of the initial page load.

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and try disabling JavaScript!

### `yarn run start:dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
